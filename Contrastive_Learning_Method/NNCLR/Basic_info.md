NNCLR method of Contrastive SSL is applied on the CIFAR dataset.  
However the exectuion is avalibale on until the traning of the model part , as i am yet to debug the evaluation code .  
However , i am providing here the complete notebook with the error as proof of concept.  
Since , some changes might be done in the future to the code , hence , there is no Concise_code file.
